cmd/: Entry point for your application (main executable). It keeps the main application logic separate from the core business logic, enhancing modularity.
internal/: Contains the core business logic, like handling URL shortening and retrieving original URLs. Grouping related logic together makes the code easier to navigate and maintain.
pkg/: Holds reusable utilities or helper functions. It prevents code duplication and encourages reusability.
api/: Holds API documentation, making it easier for others to understand and use your service.
